# criminal_database_management_django
In this project there are 5 entities - CRIME, CRIMINAL, VICTIM, TRIAL and PRISON. 
A user can create, update and delete a record from database of the respective tables. 
It can be used as an application by the police department to manage the records of different activities related to the case.
With the help of django admin we can restrict the crud operations based on different user privileges.
Admin can accsess all records, insert new record, delete record and modify records.
User or Staff can only read the records.
